    How to convert to external stylesheets?
        Create a new .css file
        Move all CSS rules from <style> tags to this file
        Link the CSS file in HTML using <link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css">
        Remove the <style> tags from HTML

    When to use each method?
        Inline: Quick testing, single-element styling, CMS systems with limited access
        Internal: Small projects, single-page applications, when styles won’t be reused
        External: Most professional projects, multi-page websites, when maintainability matters

    Best practices:
        Prefer external stylesheets for most professional work
        Use internal stylesheets for small, single-page projects
        Limit inline styles to special cases where other methods aren’t practical
        Keep CSS organized with comments and logical grouping
