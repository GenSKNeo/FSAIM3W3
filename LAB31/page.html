    <!-- Task 4: Creating a Hyperlink -->
    <a href="https://www.google.com"> Google (open in same tab)</a>
    <br>

    <br>
    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google (opens in new tab)</a>

    <!-- 
    1. When you click on it, does the current tab/window go to Google or open up a new tab/window?
        By default (without target="_blank"), the link opens in the same tab/window.
        With target="_blank", it opens in a new tab/window.

    2. What is the difference in the codes that will determine whether it is opening up in a new window or the existing window?
        The target attribute determines this behavior:
            No target attribute or target="_self" opens in the same tab/window
            target="_blank" opens in a new tab/window

    <!-- Task 5: Linking To An Image -->
     <h2>Absolute URL Image</h2>

    <h2>Relative URL Image</h2>
    <img src="pagehtml.png" alt="Local image">

<!--

    1. Do you know how to link to an absolute URL?
        Yes, an absolute URL includes the full path to the resource, including the protocol (https://) and domain name. Example:

        <img src="https://www.myserver.com/images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile">

    2. How about a relative URL?
        A relative URL specifies the path relative to the current page’s location. Example:

        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile">

        This would look for the image in an “images” folder that’s in the same directory as the HTML file.

    3. How does the relative URL work?
        Relative URLs work by building the path from the current document’s location:
            "image.jpg" looks in the same directory as the HTML file
            "images/image.jpg" looks in an “images” subdirectory
            "../image.jpg" looks in the parent directory (one level up)
            "../../image.jpg" looks two levels up, and so on
