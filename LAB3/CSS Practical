When to Use Each Method

    Inline CSS (style attribute in HTML elements)
        Best for: Quick testing, single-element styling, dynamic styles applied with JavaScript
        Example use case: When you need to override other styles for a specific element
        Limitation: Hard to maintain, not reusable, violates separation of concerns

    Internal Stylesheet (style tag in head section)
        Best for: Small projects, single-page websites, styles specific to one page
        Example use case: When you want to keep all code in one file but still separate HTML and CSS
        Limitation: Not reusable across multiple pages, can make HTML file large

    External Stylesheet (separate .css file linked with link tag)
        Best for: Most professional projects, multi-page websites, team development
        Example use case: When you want consistent styling across multiple pages
        Advantages: Reusable, maintainable, cacheable, better performance

Key Differences Summary
Method 	Location 	Scope 	Reusability 	Best For
Inline CSS 	style attribute in HTML 	Single element 	None 	Quick fixes, testing
Internal CSS 	<style> in <head> 	Current page 	Within page 	Small projects
External CSS 	Separate .css file 	All linked pages 	Across site 	Professional projects
Practical Recommendations

    For learning and quick testing: Start with inline CSS to see immediate results
    For small projects: Use internal stylesheets to keep everything in one file
    For professional work: Always use external stylesheets for better organization and maintainability
    For dynamic styles: Use inline CSS with JavaScript when you need to change styles programmatically
